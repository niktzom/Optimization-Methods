# Optimization Methods
## 2nd Assignment

Our goal is to find the minimum of a 2D function using different algorithms without restrictions for x,y.

The three method to be used are:
- Steepest Descent
- Newton
- Levenberg-Marquardt

For each method the step γ_κ is chosen with three different ways:
- Constant(of our choice)
- Such as to minimize f(x_k + γ_k * d_k)
- From the Armijo method
