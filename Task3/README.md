# Optimization Methods
## 3rd Assignment

Minimization of a 2D function but using Steepest Descent with Projection method. 

So in contrast with Task 2 we now have constraints for our x and y. We will we compare this method with the simple form of the Steepest Descent where there were no constraints. Also we will see how the method works for different starting values and starting steps.
